* EPIC Pre-doctoral Fellows Orientation (August 2019)

Welcome to EPIC! During this orientation we will brief you in about the tools we beleive will help
you the most in your RAship at EPIC. We have prepared a set of 1 hour to 1.5 hours sessions about
general programming topics and carreer and work environment talks. During this orientation you will
interact with both PIs, other pre-doctoral fellows, and current PhD students that will talk about
their carrers and their overall experiences as EPIC pre-doctoral fellows. 

In this repo, you will have all the orientation materials, and some information related to your
first days at EPIC.
   
** Agenda

EPIC orientation will take two days (Monday and Tuesday). Our sessions will take place at
Saieh 141, except for some sessions in which you will be splitted in two groups. Please be on time
for all sessions, time is limited and the material is extensive.

** Prerequisites

Before starting this orientation you will need some software first. We will guide you through the
installation process (in Unix-based machines, hopefully). Also, some of the sessions are assuming some
basic knowledge of programming languages. In general, you are expected to undertand object
structures (i.e. lists, dictionaries, matrices, etc.) and some experience in any programming
language. 

This is a comprehensive list of what we need to install:

 - Git (Install command-line tools in your MacOS) 
 - psql (PostgreSQL database client) 
 - Python (3.6+): 
   -Python packages: 
   - pandas 
   - matplotlib 
   - scikit-learn 
   - sqlalchemy 
   - psycopg2    
   - ipython 
   - jupyter 
 - R
 - RStudio
 - DBeaver (or DataGrip using your educational email) 
 - SublimeText (or PyCharm using your educational email) 
 - [If you're working on a server] Vim or if you feel with [lack of faith][2],
   use Emacs. 

*** How to install

Although you can install software using click-and-point, you can also install
software in a more programatic way. 

- MacOS users - [[file:./prerequisites/mac_homebrew.md[Instructions]]
- Linux users - You probably know how to do this already
- Windows - Change OS.
