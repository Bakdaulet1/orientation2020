    "Concurrency? Parallelism? Threading? This are the main conecpts we find everytime we want to make our code run faster. In this Notebook, we will discuss some of the concepts begind parallelism in Python, and how to try to tailormade parallel code for our specific problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some definitions first: \n",
    " - Concurrency: In Python, concurrency describes the situation where things are running simulataneously. Several things can run at the same time, in Python `thread`, `task`, `process` are equal at a high-level.\n",
    " - Parallelism: We can run processes in only one core, but ideally, we would like to run several processes using all the available cores. Parallelism describes this situation. \n",
    " - **[Advanced!]** Asynchronous: This is also known as cooperative multiprocessing, and describes the situation where a pool of processes is used to run several tasks. By definition, once a tasks finishes, it ping other tasks to start (that's why is cooperative). \n",
    " \n",
    "Not all processes are made equal: we can have different kind of data tasks that involve different needs. For instance, I can make several requests to an API, which involves waiting until the server reply to my first request to continue to the next one. This is known as *I/O bounded processes* (see Image). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../imgs/io_bound.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common type of process is where the computation task takes most of the CPU available and the next task need until the precedent finish to continue. This is a *CPU bounded process* \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../imgs/cpu_bound.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will focus on a _I/O bounded process_: retrieve data from an API or a URL\n"
